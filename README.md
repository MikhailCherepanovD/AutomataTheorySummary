###  The teacher  -  Alexey Vladimirovich Vostrov, SPBSTU, Mathematics and Computer Science

## Laboratory works:

1. [CellularAutomaton](https://github.com/MikhailCherepanovD/CellularAutomaton) - The implementation of a cellular automaton in accordance with a given option. The Bonus - Game "Life" (Python);
2. [WatchAutomaticBased](https://github.com/MikhailCherepanovD/WatchAutomaticBased) - Coursework, implementation of a clockwork mechanism based on a finite state machine in Logisim;
3. [LexemAnalyzer](https://github.com/MikhailCherepanovD/LexemAnalyzer) - A lexical analyzer based on a finite state machine. Receives the program text as input, and the output is a table of tokens.(ะก++);
4. [RegExpAnalyzer](https://github.com/MikhailCherepanovD/RegExpAnalyzer) - Analyzer of string belonging to the language specified by a regular expression based on a finite automaton (ะก++);
5. [GrammarChecker](https://github.com/MikhailCherepanovD/GrammarChecker) - The analyzer of the sentence belonging to the Past perfect passive voice of the English language. The recursive descent method is used for the analysis (Java).
6. [ExtensionMilanCompiler](https://github.com/MikhailCherepanovD/ExtentionMilanCompiler) - Extension of the Milan learning programming language with the possibility of using an enumerated type (C++).
7. [LLGrammarAnalyzer](https://github.com/MikhailCherepanovD/LLGrammarAnalyzer) - Implementation of the left-hand context-free grammar analyzer. Random chain generation and chain membership verification are implemented (C++).
